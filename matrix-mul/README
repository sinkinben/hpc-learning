Matrix Multiplication

In this project, I will introduce the optimization methods of matrix multiplication
step by step. It will include this subjects:
* CPU Cache optimization
* Parallelized Instructions (i.e. SPMD and SIMD-AVX)
* CUDA Programming
  * Naive matrix multiplication on CUDA
  * Shared memory within each block of CUDA
  * Memory mapping between device and host
